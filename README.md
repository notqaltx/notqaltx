      <b>About me:</b><br/>
      I'm 14 years old. I'm Software Engineer and UI/UX Designer. I've also created and running CortSync Company, and we're making a programming language called Fluxar.
      it's only in Pre-Alpha version, I can even say that it's not even 20 percent done. We have a lot of bugs that we need to fix. But, if you want to contribute it and help us,
      it would be really appriciated! Thank you.
