      <b>About me:</b><br/>
      I'm 14 years old Software Engineer and UI/UX Designer. I love making stuff that hard to do. For example right now I'm working on my programming language, and, I'm really proud of it and I love how it looks now.
      Right now I'm working alone at all my projects, but you can contribute Fluxar and help me! It would be really appreciated!
